        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <pre>
            How long, how long will I slide?
          Separate my side, I don't
          I don't believe it's bad
          Slit my throat it's all I ever

          I heard your voice through a photograph
          I thought it up and brought up the past
          Once you know you can never go back
          I gotta take it on the other side

          Centuries are what it meant to me
          A cemetery where I marry the sea
          Stranger things could never change my mind
          I gotta take it on the other side
          Take it on the other side
          Take it on, take it on

          How long, how long will I slide?
          Separate my side, I don't
          I don't believe it's bad
          Slit my throat it's all I ever

          Pour my life into a paper cup
          The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
          She wants to know am I still a slut
          I've got to take it on the other side

          Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
          A candidate for a soul mate bled
          Push the trigger and I pull the thread, I gotta take it on the other side
          Take it on the other side
          Take it on
          Take it on

          How long, how long will I slide?
          Separate my side, I don't
          I don't believe it's bad
          Slit my throat it's all I ever

          Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
          Burn me out, leave me on the other side
          I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
          I tear it down, I tear it down
          And then it's born again

          How long, how long will I slide?
          Separate my side, I don't
          I don't believe it's bad
          Slit my throat it's all I ever

          How long, I don't, I don't believe it's bad
          Slit my throat it's all I ever
