        <h2>How to Tie a Fly onto Your Tippet</h2>
        <br>
          <p>This is a brief tutorial site on arguably the most important part of fly fishing-- tying on the tie! Of course there are many crucial aspects to the specific equipment used whilst fly fishing, but no matter what weight line you use, what fly you select and what rod you chose to bring-- if the fly won't stay on the leader, you'll never catch a fish. Therefore I created this site to instruct others how to properly tie on a fly.</p>
        <h3>Required Materials</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Fly rod and reel with suitable line</li>
            <li>Fly</li>
            <li>Tippet that coordinates with the caliber of fishing in mind</li>
            <li>Optional: pliers</li>
            <li>Good eye sight and steady hands!</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Time to Tie!</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>Slide the end of the tippet (thinner line attached at the end of the leader) through the eyelet hole at the head of the fly. </li>
            <li>Wrap the <em>short</em> end of the line around the tippet 4-5 times</li>
            <li>Bring the <em>shorter</em>, wrapped end of the line back down to the hole created by the wrapping, in <em>front</em> of the eyelet and push the end of the line through</li>
            <li>Pull the end of the line tight. The wrapped area on the line above should compact down and create a tight bundle above the eyelet of the fly</li>
          </ol>
          <p>*Remember: There are many ways to tie on a fly, but this method seems to do the trick
