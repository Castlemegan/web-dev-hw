    <h1>About The Site</h1>

      <div id="about" class="part-1">
      <p>Fly fishing has always been a passion for me and my family. My dad taught both my brother and I how to fly fish when we were young and it is something we all do together still. Fly fishing is a unique sport in that its challenging, habitual and constanly varying. There are aspects of fly fishing that make it very challenging, such as changing conditions-- the more you fly fish the better you become becuase you learn the ability to cast in changing circumstances. It is a sport that gets better with practice and something anybody can enjoy for a lifetime. It takes focus, dedication and brings its participant to some very beautiful areas. </P>
      <p>This site was important for me to create because I feel strongly about there being a plutherea of information available to beginner fly fishermen ane fisherwomen. It is an intriquette sport and attemtping to learn it without some guidance can be overwhelming. I chose the topic of how to tie on a fly specifically because I believe this is one of the first crucial things a beginner learns that needs to be correct. Learing how to fly fish is frustrating enough, leave alone catching a fish and losing it due to a faulty knot.</p>
      There are many other resources to help learn information about fly fishing. My top favorite is your local fly shops. The employees at the local shops are generally avid flyfishermen and will be knowledgeable about what stretches of water are fishing well and what flis the fish have been biting. The shops are a goof place to start as well because they'll be able to set up beginners in a proper rod and reel for their skill-set. Other resources include youtube videos, sites such as Orvis.com have hot-to tutorials and of course, books.</p>
