# *My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo*
## Megan Castle

I am a journalism major and have decided to also attain a media arts minor. Even though I sort of struggle with technical computer skills, I believe it will make me a more well-rounded and desirable journalist when I enter the work field to have a more advanced knowledge of web development and computer design.

 * The invention of the internet through the single word 'lo' being sent from University to University is astonishing because their goal was much longer but it only took two letters to understand the process before it crashed.
 * It is interesting how the internet was originally thought of as a form of communication. I suppose that still is really what the internet's purpose is.
 * I was unaware that so many people understand how to use the internet, but not how the internet itself, functions. I for one only had a vague idea of how the internet functions.
 * I did not know that there were internet cables buried under the oceans.
