# Technical Report for Assignment 3

There should only be one head and one body element per webpage. The head elements contain the logistical information of a website. The head includes things like the viewport, a description and the author information of the webpage. The head essentially includes all of the meta data. The body element includes all of the content of the page. Contrary to the majority of the head elements, the body elements are visible to the viewers.

Semantic markup is not meant to physically alter the appearance of the website. Semantic markup makes changes so that web browsers can locate the page or read it differently. It essentially helps describe the page. Structural markup changes the actual structure and visual of the webpage. Structural markup includes things like headings, paragraphs, lists and breaks.
