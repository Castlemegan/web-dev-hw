# Assignment 2

A version control system is essentially a way to continually update and change the project whilst very effectively tracking the changes and having the ability to return back to the pre-change version very easily. This version control system is a really effective way for beginners to learn. The collaborative aspect to the version control system is also beneficial for this type of platform. Multiple people can be collaborating and working on one project but nothing is changing the original until is is decided to officially alter it. Thus multiple people can work on the same project without overlapping or implementing mistakes onto the original project. The ability to track changes stands out as a prominent benefit of this system, especially for a classroom setting.
